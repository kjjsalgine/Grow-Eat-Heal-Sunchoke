 <FONT SIZE="+1">Welcome to Grow, Eat, Heal: Sunchoke where the focus is on you and your health!<p> We're promoting 
the use of Sunchokes to provide a healthier lifestyle. Our plan is to grow and preserve<p> 
them at the Old Westbury Garden here on our campus at SUNY College at Old Westbury, <p> 
eat them, and eventually use them to heal and benefit us. <p>
