 <FONT>Welcome to Grow, Eat, Heal: Sunchoke where the focus is on you and your health! We're promoting 
the use of Sunchokes to provide a healthier lifestyle. Our plan is to grow and preserve
 them at the Old Westbury Garden here on our campus at SUNY College at Old Westbury, 
eat them, and eventually use them to heal or benefit us.
