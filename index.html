 <FONT SIZE="+1">Welcome to Grow, Eat, Heal: Sunchoke where the focus is on you and your health! We're promoting 
the use of Sunchokes to provide a healthier lifestyle. Our plan is to grow and preserve
 them at the Old Westbury Garden <p> here on our campus at SUNY College at Old Westbury, 
eat them, and eventually use them to heal or benefit us.
