Sunchokes contain inulin, a prebiotic fiber. Inulin helps improve digestive health, <p>
relieve constipation, promote weight loss, and helps to control diabetes. Studies have 
<p> proven that inulin can also provide heart health, mineral absorption, and even <p>
 colon cancer. Some of the most important minerals like,  phosphorus, iron, and <p>
 calcium can also be found within sunchokes. We need phosphorus in our bodies to  <p>
keep our bones strong and healthy and to move our muscles, iron to make red blood  <p>
 cells to carry oxygen to our body, as well as calcium to maintain strong bones and <p>
 to carry out many important body functions.
