 <FONT SIZE="+1">Sunchokes are Jerusalem Artichoke that have been grown for several years in a plot <p>
with more than 100 pounds of sunchokes at the Old Westbury Garden. Sunchokes are grown <p>
all year round. Sunchoke is a beautiful plant that grows up to 10 feet, has a smaller <p>
 flower but is similar to sunflowers with fuzzy stems. The root resembles a ginger <p>
shape and potato. It also tastes like chestnut with crunchiness and the bottom of <p>
lettuce when eaten raw, with skin or without the skin peeled.
