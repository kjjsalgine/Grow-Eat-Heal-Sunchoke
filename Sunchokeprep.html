<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Sunchokes can be prepared and eaten in a number of different ways. <p>
They can be eaten raw, pickled, roasted, or stewed. These are peeled sunchokes. What <p>
 if instead of eating regular, fatty, potato chips, you could instead choose a more <p>
healthy, hearty chip? We want to introduce and substitute Sunchoke chips into our <p>
diet.
